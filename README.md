The Weather Monitoring System is a real-time Java desktop application that retrieves live weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API. Developed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and a modern Swing-based Graphical User Interface (GUI), the system acts as a digital weather dashboard for users to view environmental conditions for any selected city. It fetches real-time weather information through Current Weather API, 5-Day Forecast API, and One Call API for retrieving advanced metrics such as the UV Index using geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude). JSON responses received from the API are parsed using the org.json library and displayed through dynamic UI components including stat cards, icons and formatted labels. The application supports user-friendly features such as city search, favourites management, Celsius/Fahrenheit unit toggle, automatic data refresh with timers, and forecast visualization — enabling accurate, rich and interactive weather monitoring on desktop devices. This project showcases how core Java can be combined with cloud-based web services to build a practical and visually appealing application for real-world usage. Key Functional Highlights • Retrieves live weather conditions from OpenWeatherMap API • Displays detailed metrics such as: o Temperature & Feels-like Temperature o Weather Condition with Emoji Icons o Humidity, Wind Speed, Pressure, Visibility o Sunrise & Sunset Times o UV Index using One Call API • Shows 5-day weather forecast with real-time updates • Allows user to: o Search any city o Add favourite cities (Noida, Delhi, Mumbai, etc.) o Toggle units (°C / °F) o Enable Auto-Refresh (Timer-based updating) • Designed with Swing GUI using panels, cards, gradients & icons for better visualization • Uses SwingWorker threads to avoid UI freezing during API requests • Requires only core Java, JSON parsing library and an active internet connection
